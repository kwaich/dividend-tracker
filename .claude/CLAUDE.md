## Project Overview

Wealthfolio addon plugin. React + Vite + TanStack Query + Tailwind v4. Fetches
Yahoo Finance dividend history, compares against existing activities, suggests
missing ones.

Key directories:

- `src/addon.tsx` — Entry point (enable/disable lifecycle)
- `src/pages/` — Route pages (DividendPage)
- `src/components/` — Tab components (SuggestionsTab, HistoryTab)
- `src/hooks/` — Data-fetching hooks (TanStack Query)
- `src/lib/` — Pure utility functions
- `src/types/` — Shared interfaces

## Quick Commands

- Dev (watch build): `pnpm dev`
- Dev server: `pnpm dev:server`
- Tests: `pnpm test`
- Type check: `pnpm type-check`
- Lint: `pnpm lint`
- Bundle for distribution: `pnpm bundle`

## Plan Mode

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if
  any.

## Behavioral Guidelines

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial
tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes,
simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it
work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer
rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before
implementation rather than after mistakes.
